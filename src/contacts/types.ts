// Frontend DTOs for the Contacts feature — Task A4, grown to the v2
// reachability superset by Task T-E (operator pivot 2026-07-10/11: a peer IS a
// contact; the separate peers.json entity died — see
// docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-10-p2p-peer-model-design.md §AMENDMENT).
//
// These MUST mirror the Rust serde shapes EXACTLY (snake_case; the codebase has
// no `rename_all` EXCEPT the enums below, which mirror `reachability.rs`'s
// `#[serde(rename_all = "kebab-case")]`). Sources of truth:
//   - `src-tauri/src/contacts/store.rs` — Contact / GroupMember / Group / ContactsFile
//   - `src-tauri/src/contacts/reachability.rs` — ContactTier / Origin / GridSource /
//     ContactGrid / ChannelTransport / Direction / Provenance / ChannelBandwidth /
//     AttemptCounts / Channel / Endpoint (the v2 reachability fields on Contact)
//   - `src-tauri/src/contacts/suggest.rs` — Suggestion
// When a Rust shape changes, this file MUST be updated in the same PR.
//
// The v2 fields (`tier`, `origin`, `grid`, `channels`, `endpoints`) all carry
// `#[serde(default)]` on the Rust side, so a `contact_upsert` write payload MAY
// omit them (the backend backfills the default) — hence `?` optional here,
// mirroring this file's own existing convention for `email`/`tactical`/`notes`
// (Option<String> fields) rather than peers/types.ts's stricter `| null`
// idiom. `contacts_read` always emits all five keys explicitly (tier/origin as
// their concrete kebab-case value, channels/endpoints as `[]` when empty, grid
// as `null` when absent) — callers on the read path should not assume absence.
