//! Routines monolith module — Tauri-side persistence, radio arbiter, action
//! catalog, and Tauri command surface over the `tuxlink-routines` engine crate.
//!
//! Spec: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-13-routines-design.md` §6 (catalog),
//! §9 (arbiter), §14 (storage). Plan:
//! `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-07-13-routines-02-actions-arbiter-mount.md`.
//!
//! **Plan 2 Task 1:** [`store::DefinitionStore`] (one `<routine>.json` file
//! per routine, portable — no runtime state in the definition itself) and
//! [`presets::RadioPresetStore`] (the Radio Preset entity CRUD,
//! `radio-presets.json` beside `config.json`).
//!
//! **Plan 2 Task 2:** [`arbiter::RadioArbiter`] — the single-owner lease
//! over a rig, shared between the operator's interactive sessions and
//! routine-run steps (spec §9).
//!
//! **Plan 2 Task 3:** [`resolver::MonolithEntityResolver`]
//! — the production `EntityResolver` that resolves `@preset:`/
//! `@station-set:`/`@identity:`/`@template:` reference tokens against the
//! real Tauri-side stores (see `resolver.rs`'s module doc for the
//! per-kind service-seam recon). [`station_sets::StationSetStore`] is a
//! new small store this task added — no named station-set/group concept
//! existed anywhere else in the codebase (see `resolver.rs` and
//! `station_sets.rs` module docs).
//!
//! **Plan 2 Task 4a:** [`actions`] — the real action catalog's service
//! seams (`ConnectService`/`AprsService`/`ListenService`),
//! `ActionDeps`/`build_registry`, and the three radio actions
//! (`radio.connect`/`radio.listen`/`radio.aprs_send`, spec §6). See
//! `actions::radio`'s module doc for the transport-seam recon and the
//! ARDOP/VARA gateway-frequency gap Task 5 must close.
//!
//! **Plan 2 Task 4b:** [`actions::cat`] — the CAT verb
//! seam (`RigService`), and the five `rig.*` actions
//! (`rig.read_state`/`rig.validate_preset`/`rig.apply_preset`/
//! `rig.switch_vfo`/`rig.tune_atu`, spec §6). Two of the five
//! (`rig.switch_vfo`, `rig.tune_atu`) have no real `tux_rig::Rig` verb to
//! delegate to and return a verbatim, seam-naming unsupported error rather
//! than a stub or a side-path fake — see `actions::cat`'s module doc for
//! the full recon.
//!
//! **Plan 2 Task 4c:** [`actions::data`] — the `DataService`
//! seam and the four `data.*` actions (`data.spacewx_wwv`/
//! `data.spacewx_swpc`/`data.stationlist_update`/`data.read`, spec §6).
//! `data.spacewx_wwv` ports the frontend's WWV/WWVH `:18`/`:45` broadcast-
//! window scheduling to Rust (the real backend capture call has no notion
//! of the schedule) and sleeps to the window before capturing — a real,
//! schedule-aware wait, not a half-wired immediate call. `data.read`'s
//! `heard_stations` and `last_connected_gateway` sources have NO backend
//! seam to delegate to (heard-station positions live only in frontend React
//! state; the last-reached gateway is never persisted past a live session)
//! and return a documented honest-gap error rather than fake data — see
//! `actions::data`'s module doc for the full recon, including the exact
//! `catalog::stations::Gateway.frequencies_khz` seam `data.stationlist_update`
//! populates that Task 5's ARDOP/VARA gateway-frequency resolver (the gap
//! `actions::radio`'s module doc names) will eventually read.
//!
//! **Plan 2 Task 4d (this landing, final action-catalog task):**
//! [`actions::local`] — the `LocalService` seam and the five `local.*`
//! actions (`local.compose`/`local.compose_catalog_request`/
//! `local.set_identity`/`local.log`/`local.notify`, spec §6). `local.compose`
//! and `local.compose_catalog_request` both stage a real B2F message via the
//! exact `winlink_backend::OutboundMessage` + `WinlinkBackend::send_message`
//! pipeline `ui_commands::message_send`/`catalog::commands::catalog_send_inquiry`
//! already use. `local.compose`'s run-scoped `from_identity` override closed
//! a genuine seam gap: `WinlinkBackend` gained a new, backward-compatible
//! `send_message_as(msg, from: Option<String>)` method (default delegates to
//! `send_message`; `NativeBackend` overrides it to compose+queue under an
//! explicit callsign without ever touching the shared `active_identity`
//! session slot) — see `actions::local`'s module doc for the full rationale.
//! `local.compose`'s template rendering delegates to the real
//! `forms::serialize::render_body_template` (`<var field_id>` tokens, the
//! same renderer the bundled Standard Forms catalog Task 3's `@template:`
//! resolver already sources from). `local.set_identity` takes NO seam at
//! all — see its own doc comment for why that is structurally, not just
//! by-convention, true. This landing also adds `tauri-plugin-notification`
//! (`Cargo.toml`/`Cargo.lock` + `lib.rs`'s plugin chain) for `local.notify`.
//! With Task 4d landed, every spec §6 action name is registered in
//! `actions::build_registry` — Task 5 (engine mount + consent stub +
//! events) and Task 6 (Tauri commands) are what remain of this plan.
//!
//! **Plan 2 Task 5a:** [`session::RoutinesState`] — the managed-state facade
//! that mounts the `tuxlink-routines` engine (built by
//! [`session::build_routines_state`]), holds the stores + arbiter + a live-run
//! registry, and bridges the engine to the UI via [`events::RoutinesEvent`] on
//! the [`events::ROUTINES_EVENT`] channel (`RunStarted`/`RunFinished` at the run
//! boundary; step-level events come from journal polling in Task 6). Launch
//! recovery ([`session::RoutinesState::recover`]) marks interrupted runs
//! terminally, emits `RunFinished{Interrupted}`, and resumes
//! `on_interrupted: resume` routines from their journal snapshot. The transmit
//! CONSENT wrapper is slice 5b — the private `start_routine_def` start
//! chokepoint leaves a clean seam for it (see that method's doc). `lib.rs`
//! `.setup()` calls
//! [`session::build_routines_state_for_app`] + `.manage()`s the result; Task 6
//! registers the commands.
//!
//! **Plan 2 Task 6 (this landing — the feature becomes reachable):**
//! [`commands`] is the Tauri command surface (authoring, the enable gate,
//! run/dry-run/cancel/status/journal/consent, and CRUD for the two authorable
//! `@`-entities), and [`validation`] is the [`MonolithValidationContext`] —
//! the production `ValidationContext` that lets the plan-3 validator run
//! against the REAL stores + the REAL action registry, which is what makes
//! validate-on-save and the block-on-errors enable gate possible. Every
//! command is a thin shim over a service fn taking `&RoutinesState`
//! (`search/commands.rs`'s pattern), so the logic is unit-tested without a
//! Tauri runtime. Task 6 also routes `routines_dry_run` through the engine's
//! own [`tuxlink_routines::engine::Engine::start_dry_run`] (the registry swap
//! that makes a dry run touch nothing real) and bounds the session's live-run
//! registry (Task 5a's carried Low finding).
//!
//! **Plan 2 Task 6b (the schedules become live):** [`scheduler`] — the tick
//! loop that FIRES schedule-triggered routines. Before it, an enabled
//! `Trigger::Schedule` routine validated, enabled, and fleet-checked, and then
//! nothing ever happened: the schedule MATH lived in the leaf
//! (`tuxlink_routines::scheduler`'s pure `next_fire`/`missed_fires`) but the
//! tick loop was deliberately left to the app layer, because firing means
//! creating a run and run creation is what [`session`] owns. One tokio task
//! ([`scheduler::RoutinesScheduler::spawn`], wired in `lib.rs` `.setup()`)
//! computes the earliest fire across the enabled fleet, sleeps to it, fires
//! every routine due at that instant through the same gated path the operator's
//! Run button takes, and recomputes — waking early on any routine-library
//! change (the command layer's existing `LibraryChanged` emit is the
//! chokepoint). It reconciles missed fires at launch per each trigger's
//! `if_missed` policy (spec §8: `skip` records them visibly, `run_once_on_launch`
//! fires ONE catch-up run), persists a `routines-last-fire.json` anchor map, and
//! never overlaps a routine with itself. Every fire outcome — started, skipped,
//! refused, missed — is a [`events::RoutinesEvent`] variant.
//!
//! That other, banned six-syllable term for scripted automation never
//! appears in this module's symbols, JSON keys, or docs (spec Global
//! Constraints) — the feature is Routines.
